# Chapter 7: TsFile

## Installation

Before started, maven should be installed. See <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">How to install maven</a>

There are two ways to use TsFile in your own project.

* Using as jars:
	* Compile the source codes and build to jars
	
		```
		git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb.git
		cd tsfile/
		sh package.sh
		```
		Then, all the jars can be get in folder named `lib/`. Import `lib/tsfile-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to your project.
	
* Using as a maven dependency: 

	Compile source codes and deploy to your local repository in three steps:

	* Get the source codes
	
		```
		git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb.git
		```
	* Compile the source codes and deploy 
		
		```
		cd tsfile/
		mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
		```
	* add dependencies into your project:
	
	  ```
		 <dependency>
		   <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
		   <artifactId>tsfile</artifactId>
		   <version>0.9.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		 </dependency>
	  ```
	  
	Or, you can download the dependencies from official Maven repository:
	
	* First, find your maven `settings.xml` on path: `${username}\.m2\settings.xml`
	  , add this `<profile>` to `<profiles>`:
	  ```
	    <profile>
           <id>allow-snapshots</id>
              <activation><activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault></activation>
           <repositories>
             <repository>  
                <id>apache.snapshots</id>
                <name>Apache Development Snapshot Repository</name>
                <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
                <releases>
                    <enabled>false</enabled>
                </releases>
                <snapshots>
                    <enabled>true</enabled>
                </snapshots>
              </repository>
           </repositories>
         </profile>
	  ```
	* Then add dependencies into your project:
	
	  ```
		 <dependency>
		   <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
		   <artifactId>tsfile</artifactId>
		   <version>0.9.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		 </dependency>
	  ```
