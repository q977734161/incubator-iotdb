# Introduction
The Sync Tool is an IoTDB suite tool that periodically uploads persistent tsfiles from the sender disk to the receiver and loads them.

On the sender side of the sync, the sync module is a separate process, independent of the IoTDB process. It can be started and closed through a separate script (see Sections `Usage` for details). The frequency cycle of the sync can be set by the user. 

On the receiver side of the sync, the sync module is embedded in the engine of IoTDB and is in the same process with IoTDB. The receiver module listens for a separate port, which can be set by the user (see Section `Configuration` for details). Before using it, it needs to set up a whitelist at the sync receiver, which is expressed as a network segment. The receiver only accepts the data transferred from the sender located in the whitelist segment, as detailed in Section `Configuration`. 

The sync tool has a many-to-one sender-receiver mode - that is, one sync receiver can receive data from multiple sync senders simultaneously while one sync sender can only send data to one sync receiver.

> Note: Before using the sync tool, the client and server need to be configured separately. The configuration is detailed in Sections Configuration.
# Configuration
## Sync Receiver
The parameter configuration of the sync receiver is located in the configuration file `iotdb-engine.properties` of IoTDB, and its directory is `$IOTDB_HOME/conf/iotdb-engine.properties`. In this configuration file, there are four parameters related to the sync receiver. The configuration instructions are as follows:

<table>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="2">parameter: is_sync_enable</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td width="30%">Description</td>
      <td>Sync function switch, which is configured as true to indicate that the receiver is allowed to receive the data from the sender and load it. When set to false, it means that the receiver is not allowed to receive the data from any sender. </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Type</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Default</td>
      <td>false</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Modalities for Entry into Force after Modification</td>
      <td>Restart receiver</td>
   </tr>
</table>

<table>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="2">parameter: IP_white_list</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td width="30%">Description</td>
      <td>Set up a white list of sender IP addresses, which is expressed in the form of network segments and separated by commas between multiple network segments. When the sender transfers data to the receiver, only when the IP address of the sender is within the network segment set by the whitelist can the receiver allow the sync operation. If the whitelist is empty, the receiver does not allow any sender to sync data. The default receiver accepts all IP sync requests.</td>

      <td>The processing strategy chosen by the sync receiver when merging the sync data.<br/>
        1. If the sync data accounts for more than 50% of the update of the historical data (compared with the latest timestamp of the local storage group data),then it is recommended this parameter be set to TRUE, which has a greater impact on the write performance and reduce CPU usage.<br/>
        2. If the sync data accounts for less than 50% of the update of the historical data (compared with the latest timestamp of the local storage group data),then it is recommended this parameter be set to FALSE,which has little impact on the write performance and takes up a large amount of CPU power.<br/>

## Sync Sender
The parameters of the sync sender are configured in a separate configuration file iotdb-sync-client.properties with the installation directory of ```$IOTDB_HOME/conf/iotdb-sync-client.properties```. In this configuration file, there are five parameters related to the sync sender. The configuration instructions are as follows:
<table>
   <tr>
      <td colspan="2">parameter: server_ip</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td width="30%">Description</td>
      <td>IP address of sync receiver.</td>

# Usage
## Start Sync Receiver
1. Set up parameters of sync receiver. For example:
<img style="width:100%; max-width:800px; max-height:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26211279/59494502-daaa4380-8ebf-11e9-8bce-363e2433005a.png">
2. Start IoTDB engine, and the sync receiver will start at the same time, and the LOG log will start with the sentence `IoTDB: start SYNC ServerService successfully` indicating the successful start of the return receiver.
<img style="width:100%; max-width:800px; max-height:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26211279/59494513-df6ef780-8ebf-11e9-83e1-ee8ae64b76d0.png">

## Stop Sync Receiver
Stop IoTDB and the sync receiver will be closed at the same time.

## Start Sync Sender
1. Set up parameters of sync sender. For example:
<img style="width:100%; max-width:800px; max-height:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26211279/59494559-f9a8d580-8ebf-11e9-875e-355199c1a1e9.png">
